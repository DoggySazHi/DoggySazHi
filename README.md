# William H. Le: a.k.a. DoggySazHi

Hi, I program and stuff. There are two main projects that I work on here currently:
- UNObot (private): A bot. That used to only play UNO. [Invite it!](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=477616287997231105&permissions=8192&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
- Modulr: An online stipulator, written in C# (.NET 5) originally for Java programs, for use in a school/sandboxed environment.

I am also doing some of the Allen Wittry problems for fun.

## Who are you?
I'm a high school (and soon to be college) student. I write programs for fun, and many of them go unpublished because I don't think they're appealing to the public.
- Like look, [Minecraft sheep playing the "Bad Apple!!" PV!](https://williamle.com/staticstuff/Bad_Apple_Demo.mp4)
I program mostly in C# and Java, however I can do web development (see Modulr), machine learning in Python (internship code which I cannot publish), and C++ (an OpenGL personal project).

## Why?
Mukyu.
