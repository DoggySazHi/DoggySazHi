# William H. Le: a.k.a. DoggySazHi

Hi, I program and stuff. There are two main projects that I work on here currently:

- Cow: A Discord bot for UC Merced Discord servers.
- UniScraper: Utilities for grabbing class information from the UCM Registrar and Rate My Professor.

## Who am I?
I'm a fresh graduate from the University of California, Merced in Computer Science and Engineering. I write programs for fun, and some I choose to publish here.
- Like look, [Minecraft sheep playing the "Bad Apple!!" PV!](https://williamle.com/staticstuff/Bad_Apple_Demo.mp4)
  - [Here's the code.](https://github.com/DoggySazHi/RCONHelper)

I develop mostly in .NET/C# due to my familiarity with it, but:
- I'm proficient in Java, Rust, Python (data analysis/machine learning), and C++.
- I do back-end development well, utilizing ASP.NET Core, SQL databases (MS-SQL Server and MySQL/MariaDB), and other smaller libraries depending on the task.
- I can do web development (HTML/CSS/JS/TS, or frameworks like React or Vue), albeit I am not the biggest fan of it.
- Other miscellaneous tools I know/use: OpenCV (C++/Python), TensorFlow 2 + Keras (Python), Qt (C++), OpenGL (C++)

I currently work as a software developer/technical consultant for Sage X3 and Sage 100 with [Platform Technology Advisors](https://platformtechnologyadvisors.com/). In my downtime, I am also a software developer and system admin for [Gensokyo Reimagined](https://github.com/Gensokyo-Reimagined/), writing Minecraft Java plugins and maintaining the Docker server infrastructure.
