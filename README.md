# William H. Le: a.k.a. DoggySazHi

Hi, I program and stuff. There are two main projects that I work on here currently:
- Cow: A Discord bot for UC Merced Discord servers.
- UniScraper: Utilities for grabbing class information from the UCM Registrar and Rate My Professor.

*Note: I have been/will be updating these projects less frequently due to my internship with Walpole ITS.*

## Who am I?
I'm a sophomore college CSE student. I write programs for fun, and some I choose to publish here.
- Like look, [Minecraft sheep playing the "Bad Apple!!" PV!](https://williamle.com/staticstuff/Bad_Apple_Demo.mp4)
  - [Here's the code.](https://github.com/DoggySazHi/RCONHelper)
I program mostly in C# and Java, however I can do web development (see Modulr), machine learning in Python (internship code which I cannot publish), Rust (See classAndrew/cow), and C++ (an OpenGL personal project).

## Why?
むきゅ。
